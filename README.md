# Open Data & Web Apps with Ember.js

This is the repo for my talk at #webNotWar #mtl Feb 5, 2016 about using Ember for an Open Data project.  The techniques used in this presentation are more about how to use Ember's Adapter object class to transform/serialize data you want to use/read from (our open data sources) into native Ember Data object types that can then be used to output our data in whatever that best suits the data.

The repo is divided into three parts:

- ```ember_app```
- ```json_api_server``` a simple node/express server that returns a simple JSON api to consume
- ```html_data``` a plain old HTML page with some tabled data to be used/scraped

## This talk isn't

- Not an overview of setting up Ember
